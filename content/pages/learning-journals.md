The learning journal prompts are short assignments that ask you to reflect on your own educational history, imagine a new future, or read something closely. These assignments will typically be a few hundred words or their multimedia equivalent in images, audio, video, code, etc. You may respond to the prompt in words, images, videos, cartoons, code, links, gifs, etc.  Most, but not all, sessions have a learning journal assignment to be done before arriving at that session.
